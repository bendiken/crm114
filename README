== CRM114 Controllable Regex Mutilator for Ruby

This is a Ruby interface to the CRM114 Controllable Regex Mutilator, an
advanced and fast text classifier that uses sparse binary polynomial
matching with a Bayesian Chain Rule evaluator and a hidden Markov model to
categorize data with up to a 99.87% accuracy.

The Ruby wrapper grew out of this:

== Dependencies

Requires the CRM114 binaries to be installed. Specifically, the '+crm+'

Classifier[http://rubyforge.org/projects/classifier/] project.

Here follows a brief example:

  require 'crm114'
  crm = Classifier::CRM114.new([:interesting, :boring])
  crm.train! :interesting, 'Some data set with a decent signal to noise ratio.'
  crm.train! :boring, 'Pig latin, as in lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.'
  crm.classify 'Lorem ipsum'       => [:boring, 0.99]
  crm.interesting? 'Lorem ipsum'   => false
  crm.boring? 'Lorem ipsum'        => true

Have a look at the included unit tests for more comprehensive examples.
